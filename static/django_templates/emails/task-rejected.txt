Hi,
\n
We at Daemo try hard to ensure that workers and requesters engage in dialogue to improve work. After one or more rounds of revision,
the requester for "{{ project_name }}" has indicated that the submissions you sent are not meeting expectations. Their final feedback:
"{{ reject_reason }}"
\n
At this point, they are rejecting the work and releasing it to other workers to complete instead.
This has no direct impact on your reputation on Daemo: all reputation information is captured via the Priority/Normal/Late feedback.
However, you will not receive payment for the incomplete work.

\n
In cases where the requester is abusing their privileges by rejecting high-quality work, we will review the case and make a determination.
If you wish to contest the rejection, send an email to daemo@cs.stanford.edu including the project name, the requester,
and a summary of the interaction: the revisions that were requested, and the revisions that you made in response.

\n
\n
